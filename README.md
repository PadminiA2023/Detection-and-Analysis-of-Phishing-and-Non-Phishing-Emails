# Detection-and-Analysis-of-Phishing-and-Non-Phishing-Emails

This project leverages machine learning to detect phishing emails, a major cybersecurity threat. Using the Nazario dataset, which includes both phishing and non-phishing emails, we engineered critical features and trained multiple models. Our Gradient Boosting model achieved an accuracy of 92.65%, providing robust protection by automatically identifying and blocking phishing attempts, significantly enhancing email security.
